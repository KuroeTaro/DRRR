# DRRR
 a arcsysy fighting game prototype base on Durarara!
 
You will need to download a LOVE framework yourself then drag and drop the entire DRRR folder into LOVE.exe to run this repository.
I've only made the character selection and start screen now, so I'll update as soon as I've recovered the character interaction part, so don't worry.

The primary goal of this project is to lower the barrier to entry for fighting games, the exact methodology and direction of future updates are linked here.
